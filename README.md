# Feather Lyrics

## How does it work?

The APP's puts working on background a BroadcastReceiver that gets the song name and artist from the the current playing track.
When the user interface is opened, the APP takes the data collected by the BroadcastReceiver. When user demands it, lyrics from the actual song are downloaded.

· The app uses two API's:

- Vagalume API -> http://api.vagalume.com.br/docs/
- Spotify API -> https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/

The lyrics, and album arts are taken from Vagalume's API, artist pictures are taken from Spotfy's API.

- Firebase -> https://www.firebase.com/
